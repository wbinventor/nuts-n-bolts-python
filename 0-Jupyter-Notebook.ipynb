This series of Jupyter notebooks serve as a template for the material we will cover in the seminar.

    "We will not be able to cover all of the topics discussed in Jake's repositories, but I highly recommend them if you are interested in further developing your skills with Python after this seminar. This seminar is not designed to teach you all of Python from the ground up, but rather to provide a survey of those Python-based tools which are most useful for scientific computing and data science. Hopefully you will find it valuable for your coursework and research!"

    "\n",
    "Conceived in the late 1980s as a teaching and scripting language, Python has since become an essential tool for many programmers, engineers, researchers, and data scientists across academia and industry. The appeal of Python is in its simplicity and beauty, as well as the convenience of the large ecosystem of domain-specific tools that have been built on top of it. For example, most of the Python code in scientific computing and data science is built around a group of mature and useful packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [NumPy](http://numpy.org) provides efficient storage and computation for multi-dimensional data arrays.\n",
    "- [SciPy](http://scipy.org) contains a wide array of numerical tools such as numerical integration and interpolation.\n",
    "- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) provides a DataFrame object along with a powerful set of methods to manipulate, filter, group, and transform data.\n",
    "- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) provides a useful interface for creation of publication-quality plots and figures.\n",
    "- [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org) provides a uniform toolkit for applying common machine learning algorithms to data.\n",
    "- [IPython/Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) provides an enhanced terminal and an interactive notebook environment that is useful for exploratory analysis, as well as creation of interactive, executable documents. For example, the manuscript for this report was composed entirely in Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "No less important are the numerous other tools and packages which accompany these: if there is a scientific or data analysis task you want to perform, chances are someone has written a package that will do it for you."

    "This means that it is executed line by line, which allows programming to be interactive in a way that is not directly possible with compiled languages like Fortran, C, or Java. This section will describe three primary ways you can run Python code: the *Python interpreter*, via *self-contained scripts*, or in the *Jupyter notebook*."

    "For example, let's create a script called *test.py* which contains the following:\n",
    "``` python\n",
